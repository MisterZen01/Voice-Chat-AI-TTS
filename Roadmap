Roadmap
-This roadmap outlines the planned features and improvements for YouTube Live Chat and Realtime Speech-to-Text interation integration. These enhancements aim to expand functionality and improve user experience.

Future Changes (TBA):
- Have two AI's be able to communicate with each other
- Eventually replace PyCharacterAI with a simple lightweight deep learning ai model
- Maybe add a Text-to-Speech (TTS) function for YouTube Live Chat to speak before the AI replies back
- The TTS function for YouTube Live Chat would be customizable using the user's choice of voice (would fill in voice_name and/or client.utils.search_voices())
- Have the character be able to shout, whisper, and have a more variable voice when speaking
- Find better voice models other than Character.AI
- Prevent AI's reponses from being cutoff mid-sentence
- Being able to upload voices (I think that's a feauture in PyCharacterAI using client.utils.upload_voice)
- Have the AI be able to see what's on the User's screen
- Have the AI be able to see through the the User's webcam
- Have an AI avatar pop up on screen when speaking when streaming and for enterainment purposes (for streamers)
- Make code compatible with Twitch Livestreams and Discord Servers
